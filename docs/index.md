# Welcome to RustSmith Documentation!

!!! warning

    Documentation is still a work-in-progress!

RustSmith is a randomized program fuzzer for the Rust programming language that will generate valid programs that 
exercise multiple parts of the Rust programming language, in an attempt to uncover bugs in Rust compilers.

Check out the documentation on the left to get started and learn about all its features!
